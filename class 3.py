# What is variable?

#A varible is like a container that hold data.
# a=1
# print(a)
# b="bravery"
# print(b)
# c=None
# print(c)
# d=True
# print(d)

# What is datatype in phyton?

# data type is the type of values which holds varible.This is required in programming that perform 
# an opperation withput causing an KeyError
# "In python we can print the type of varible using type function."

# print("The type of a is:",type(a))

# print("The type of a is:",type(b))

# print("The type of a is:",type(c))

# print("The type of a is:",type(d))

# for concatenating we use same datatype eles is give error
# a =1 
# b = "Bahadur"
# print(a+b) 
# error produce
# if both have same datatpye then you can concatenate the varible

#    complex number
a = [2 + 3j, -4 - 5j]
print("a =", a)

# for dictinory
dict1 ={"name":"Bahadur khan","age":22, "yes can vote":"true"}

print(dict1)
