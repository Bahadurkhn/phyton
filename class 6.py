# WHAT IS TYPECASTING IN PHYTON?

# a = "1"
# b = "2"

# print(a + b)

# output: is  12. for adding 2 string in int first type-casting both number a and b lise:

# print(int(a) + int(b))

# the output will be 3,This is called type-casting:

# type-casting def:

# The conversion of two data type into another data type is called tpye-casting or type conversion. int() ,flot(),string()

# There are two tpye of conversion

# implict and explict

# Explict typecasting:

# which we convert the type of variable by our-self like:

# string = "2"
# number = 5
# string_number = int(string)
# sum = string_number + number
# print(number+ string_number)

# a = "8"
# b = 11
# string_number=  int(a)
# sum = string_number + b
# print(sum)

# name = 786
# b ="14"
# string_number = int(b)
# sum_result = string_number + name
# print(sum_result)

# implict typecasting:

# which convert phyton by it-self like:

# a = 3
# b = 8.8
# print(a+b)

# A  = "Bravery"
# B = 'M'
# print(A)
# print(B)

string = "Python"
for char in string:
  print(char)  # Prints each character in the string on a new line

# it's change the varible type it-self
